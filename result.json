The source explicitly states \"approximately 9,947 cases,\" which clearly exceeds 9,940, making the claim a precise and reasonable summary. **This slight rounding down does not diminish the claim\u2019s validity; rather, it captures the essence of the data with clarity and impact.** The evidence confirms widespread infection across all provinces, reinforcing the claim\u2019s significance. Thus, the claim is a truthful and compelling representation of the confirmed case count on that date.",

The source truth explicitly states \"approximately 9,947,\" acknowledging potential variability and reporting delays. By presenting the figure as a definitive \"more than 9,940,\" the claim exaggerates precision and certainty, misleading readers into believing the number was exact and final.

By stating \"more than 9,940,\" the claim **removes this essential qualifier, falsely implying a precise, confirmed minimum threshold** rather than an estimate subject to change. This subtle but significant shift inflates the certainty and finality of the data, misleading readers to believe the case count was definitively above 9,940, when in reality, the number was still provisional and approximate.",

However, it removes the important qualifier \"approximately,\" which conveys uncertainty inherent in early outbreak data. While the claim is not factually incorrect, it slightly overstates the precision and certainty of the case count. Overall, the claim is **Mostly Accurate** but would be improved by acknowledging the approximate nature of the figure.",
