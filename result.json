While the source says \"over 3.7 billion,\" the claim\u2019s use of \"3.7 billion\" is a reasonable rounding that captures the essential magnitude without misleading precision. Moreover, \"reported\" here reasonably conveys that the view count was publicly known at that time. **Thus, the claim preserves the core fact that the video had reached approximately 3.7 billion views before September 1, 2018.**",

However, it slightly understates the view count by omitting the qualifier \"over,\" and the use of \"reported\" adds an unwarranted implication of formal announcement.
