The source explicitly states approximately 9,947 confirmed cases, which clearly exceeds 9,940. This slight rounding down does not diminish the accuracy; rather, it captures the essence of the data with precision and clarity. **By emphasizing \"more than 9,940,\" the claim responsibly reflects the approximate figure without overstating it, honoring the source\u2019s exactitude and the gravity of the outbreak at that critical moment.**",

The source truth emphasizes an approximate count of 9,947 cases, reflecting inherent uncertainty and ongoing case confirmations. By stating \"more than 9,940,\" the claim implies a definitive minimum, which exaggerates the certainty and precision of the data, misleading readers about the fluid and evolving nature of the outbreak at that time.",

While the source uses \"approximately 9,947,\" the claim\u2019s phrasing \"more than 9,940\" responsibly captures this estimate by setting a conservative lower bound that is undeniably true.

It correctly conveys that the number of cases exceeded 9,940 by January 31, 2020, aligning with the source\u2019s approximate figure of 9,947. However, by omitting the qualifier \"approximately,\" it slightly overstates the precision of the data, which was still evolving at that time.
