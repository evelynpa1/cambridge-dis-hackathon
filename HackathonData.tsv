1	The company has not entered into a partnership with Tesla.	The company currently has no partnership agreement with Tesla.	Both state there is no Tesla partnership in effect at present.	Internal could be about past action (not entered) while external could allow informal collaboration or talks without an agreement.	business_finance	numerical_rounding_precision	high	high_ambiguity_numbers
2	No layoffs are planned for the upcoming fiscal year.	The company does not expect layoffs in the upcoming fiscal year.	‘Planned’ and ‘does not expect’ both communicate layoffs are not anticipated.	‘Planned’ is a concrete internal plan; ‘does not expect’ is a forecast that could still allow contingency plans.	business_finance	modality_commitment_shift;strength_intensity_shift	high	high_ambiguity_modality
3	Management is reviewing cost structures across departments.	Management is considering cost-saving measures across departments.	Reviewing costs is commonly done to identify cost-saving measures.	A review could be informational only; ‘considering measures’ implies intent to act.	business_finance	near_paraphrase	medium	general
4	The pilot program on Product A ended earlier than initially scheduled.	The Product A pilot concluded ahead of schedule.	Both say the pilot ended earlier than planned.	Internal might mean terminated prematurely (problem); external frames it as smoothly ‘concluded’.	business_finance	modality_commitment_shift	high	high_ambiguity_modality
5	Expansion into Southeast Asia remains under evaluation.	Southeast Asia is being considered as a potential expansion region.	Both describe the same exploration stage for expansion.	‘Under evaluation’ could include a broader strategy review, while ‘being considered’ could imply a lighter, less formal process.	business_finance	threshold_boundary_scope;scope_condition_omission	high	high_ambiguity_scope
6	The board approved a revised 2026 operating plan on 12 Dec 2025.	On 12 Dec 2025, the board signed off on an updated 2026 operating plan.	‘Approved’ and ‘signed off’ are standard equivalents in governance contexts.	‘Revised’ vs ‘updated’ may differ in magnitude; ‘signed off’ could be informal acknowledgment rather than formal approval.	business_finance	modality_commitment_shift	high	high_ambiguity_modality
7	The company will pause hiring for non-critical roles through Q2 2026.	Hiring will be limited to critical roles through Q2 2026.	Both indicate only critical roles will be hired for in that period.	‘Pause’ suggests a hard stop; ‘limited’ suggests some discretion beyond critical roles.	business_finance	temporal_framing_precision	medium	general
8	Customer churn declined from 3.2% to 2.9% in Q4 2025.	Q4 2025 churn fell to 2.9% from 3.2%.	Same numbers and direction; just reordered.	Internal may be net churn; external could be gross churn if not specified in the claim.	business_finance	near_paraphrase	medium	general
9	The company is renegotiating its primary logistics contract effective March 2026.	The company is in talks to update its main logistics contract for March 2026.	Renegotiating and being in talks to update capture the same activity and timing.	‘Renegotiating’ implies active contract terms bargaining; ‘in talks’ could include early discussions without renegotiation.	business_finance	near_paraphrase	medium	general
10	The new pricing policy applies to new customers starting 1 Feb 2026.	Starting 1 Feb 2026, the new pricing policy will affect new customer sign-ups.	Both set the same date and scope (new customers).	Internal could exclude renewals; external could be read as covering any new sign-up events including renewals treated as sign-ups.	business_finance	temporal_framing_precision	medium	general
11	The company received 14 formal bids during the RFP window (1–20 Nov 2025).	The RFP period (1–20 Nov 2025) resulted in 14 bids.	Same count and same RFP period; paraphrase.	‘Formal bids’ is specific; ‘bids’ might include incomplete or non-compliant submissions.	business_finance	temporal_framing_precision	medium	general
12	The merger integration timeline was extended by two weeks due to data migration issues.	Data migration issues pushed the integration timeline back by about two weeks.	Both attribute a ~2-week delay to data migration problems.	‘Extended’ could mean official plan revision; ‘pushed back’ could mean slippage without formal re-baselining; ‘about’ adds uncertainty.	business_finance	modality_commitment_shift;numerical_rounding_precision;temporal_framing_precision;causality_vs_sequence	high	high_ambiguity_modality
13	The company expects 2026 capex to be between $480M and $520M.	2026 capex is projected at roughly $500M.	A midpoint summary (~$500M) reasonably represents the stated range.	A point estimate loses the uncertainty range and could mislead if capex lands at extremes.	business_finance	modality_commitment_shift;numerical_rounding_precision	high	high_ambiguity_modality
14	The sales team expanded coverage to 12 additional cities in Latin America.	The company increased Latin America sales coverage by adding 12 cities.	Both state the same expansion by 12 cities in Latin America.	‘Expanded coverage’ might be partial presence; ‘adding cities’ could imply full local offices or direct operations.	business_finance	temporal_framing_precision	medium	general
15	The company’s largest customer represented 9.8% of revenue in FY2025.	The top customer accounted for about 10% of FY2025 revenue.	Rounding 9.8% to ‘about 10%’ is common and directionally consistent.	‘Largest’ vs ‘top’ is similar, but ‘about 10%’ may obscure a materiality threshold just under 10%.	business_finance	numerical_rounding_precision;threshold_boundary_scope;entity_specificity	high	high_ambiguity_numbers
16	Management said the restructuring will not affect customer-facing support hours.	Management said customer-facing support hours will remain unchanged during the restructuring.	Both assert customer-facing support hours won’t change.	‘Will not affect’ could allow temporary fluctuations; ‘remain unchanged’ implies stricter invariance.	business_finance	temporal_framing_precision	medium	general
17	The company’s net promoter score rose by 4 points after the November release.	After the November release, NPS increased by four points.	Same metric change and same temporal anchor.	Internal might mean a statistically adjusted NPS; external could imply raw NPS without methodology.	business_finance	temporal_framing_precision;causality_vs_sequence;scope_condition_omission	high	high_ambiguity_scope
18	The procurement policy requires two approvals for purchases above CHF 50,000.	Purchases over CHF 50,000 need two approvers under the procurement policy.	Same threshold and same rule; wording differs.	‘Above’ excludes exactly CHF 50,000; ‘over’ may be interpreted the same but could include CHF 50,000 depending on policy language.	business_finance	threshold_boundary_scope	high	high_ambiguity_numbers
19	The company will sunset Product B on 30 Sep 2026.	Product B will be discontinued at the end of September 2026.	Same month and end-of-life concept.	‘30 Sep’ is exact; ‘end of September’ could mean earlier/later operational cutoffs and different time zones.	business_finance	temporal_framing_precision	medium	general
20	The internal audit found three control gaps rated 'medium' severity.	The audit identified three medium-severity control gaps.	Same count and severity category; paraphrase.	‘Internal audit’ vs ‘audit’ could be confused with external audit; rating rubric might differ from plain ‘medium-severity’.	business_finance	near_paraphrase	medium	general
21	The company plans to open one new warehouse in Poland in 2026.	A warehouse expansion in Poland is planned for 2026.	Both indicate a planned warehouse addition in Poland in 2026.	External omits ‘one’ and could imply multiple warehouses or broader expansion beyond a single site.	business_finance	modality_commitment_shift	high	high_ambiguity_modality
22	The marketing campaign will run for 8 weeks starting 15 Jan 2026.	Starting 15 Jan 2026, the campaign is scheduled for an eight-week run.	Same start date and duration.	‘Will run’ suggests confirmed execution; ‘scheduled’ could imply it may still change.	business_finance	modality_commitment_shift;temporal_framing_precision;strength_intensity_shift	high	high_ambiguity_modality
23	The company’s customer satisfaction survey had 1,040 respondents.	The satisfaction survey included about 1,000 respondents.	Rounded respondent count captures the same scale.	Rounding may be misleading for margin-of-error calculations; ‘about 1,000’ could hide whether 1,040 met a sampling threshold.	business_finance	numerical_rounding_precision	high	high_ambiguity_numbers
24	The company’s policy prohibits gifts above CHF 200 from vendors.	Vendor gifts over CHF 200 are not allowed under company policy.	Same threshold and prohibition.	‘Above’ vs ‘over’ and policy exception language may differ; external might ignore approved exceptions.	business_finance	threshold_boundary_scope	high	high_ambiguity_numbers
25	The model achieved 3% higher accuracy on Benchmark X with increased computational cost.	Benchmark X accuracy improved by 3% while compute requirements increased.	Both describe the same accuracy gain and trade-off.	‘Computational cost’ may include training + inference; ‘compute requirements’ might be read as only inference or only training.	technology_rnd	temporal_framing_precision	medium	general
26	The algorithm converged after approximately 1,200 iterations.	Convergence occurred at around 1,200 iterations.	Near-identical numeric claim; simple paraphrase.	‘Approximately’ vs ‘around’ is similar, but ‘converged’ could mean strict threshold, while ‘occurred’ could be loosely defined.	technology_rnd	numerical_rounding_precision;causality_vs_sequence;strength_intensity_shift	high	high_ambiguity_numbers
27	The system maintained uptime above 99.95% over the last 12 months.	Over the last 12 months, uptime did not fall below 99.95%.	Same floor and same period.	Internal may refer to SLA-measured uptime; external might imply observed uptime for all users, including planned maintenance.	technology_rnd	modality_commitment_shift;threshold_boundary_scope;scope_condition_omission	high	high_ambiguity_scope
28	Failure rates declined to 0.6% following the redesign.	After the redesign, failures occurred in 0.6% of cases.	Same rate and causal ordering.	‘Declined to’ implies a before/after comparison; external could be read as only reporting post-redesign rate without confirming decline.	technology_rnd	causality_vs_sequence	high	high_ambiguity_causality
29	Latency decreased from 240 ms to 190 ms after migrating 70% of workloads.	After migrating 70% of workloads, latency fell to 190 ms from 240 ms.	Same before/after metrics and migration fraction.	Could differ on percentile (p50 vs p95) if not stated; also migration may correlate rather than cause.	technology_rnd	causality_vs_sequence;scope_condition_omission	high	high_ambiguity_scope
30	The prototype reduced energy consumption by 18% over six months of testing.	During six months of testing, the prototype lowered energy use by 18%.	Same period and reduction.	‘Energy consumption’ could be total facility energy; ‘energy use’ might be per-unit or per-transaction.	technology_rnd	threshold_boundary_scope;temporal_framing_precision	high	high_ambiguity_numbers
31	The security patch addressed 7 vulnerabilities rated 'high' severity.	Seven high-severity vulnerabilities were remediated in the security patch.	Same count and severity class.	‘Addressed’ could include mitigations or partial fixes; ‘remediated’ implies fully fixed.	technology_rnd	strength_intensity_shift	high	high_ambiguity_strength
32	The new battery chemistry reached 500 charge cycles at 80% capacity retention.	The battery retained 80% capacity after 500 charge cycles.	Same milestone restated.	Internal might be lab conditions; external reads as real-world performance.	technology_rnd	causality_vs_sequence	high	high_ambiguity_causality
33	The firmware update improved Bluetooth stability under heavy interference.	Bluetooth stability improved after the firmware update, especially under interference.	Both report improved stability in interference conditions.	Internal is conditional (‘under heavy interference’); external could be interpreted as broader, general stability.	technology_rnd	threshold_boundary_scope;causality_vs_sequence	high	high_ambiguity_numbers
34	The team froze feature development for Release 3.2 on 10 Jan 2026.	Release 3.2 entered feature-freeze on 10 Jan 2026.	Same milestone and date.	‘Froze feature development’ might allow critical exceptions; ‘entered feature-freeze’ may imply a stricter process gate.	technology_rnd	near_paraphrase	medium	general
35	The API rate limit is 120 requests per minute per token.	Each token is limited to 120 API requests per minute.	Same limit and scope.	Internal says ‘per token’ explicitly; external could be misread as per user or per account.	technology_rnd	near_paraphrase	medium	general
36	The team reduced build time by 35% after caching dependencies.	Dependency caching cut build time by about 35%.	Same change and cause in brief.	‘About’ introduces uncertainty; build time metric might differ (CI vs local)	technology_rnd	numerical_rounding_precision;temporal_framing_precision;causality_vs_sequence	high	high_ambiguity_numbers
37	The recommendation system increased click-through rate from 2.1% to 2.4% in A/B test #17.	In A/B test #17, CTR rose from 2.1% to 2.4% with the new recommender.	Same test and same numbers.	Could differ if internal CTR is unique users vs impressions; ‘new recommender’ implies a single cause rather than combined changes.	technology_rnd	temporal_framing_precision	medium	general
38	The R&D roadmap targets a 2027 launch for the next-generation sensor.	The next-generation sensor is aimed for launch in 2027.	Both indicate a 2027 target launch.	‘Targets’ is aspirational; ‘is aimed’ could be interpreted as more committed or as a public promise.	technology_rnd	near_paraphrase	medium	general
39	The dataset used for training contained 12.3 million labeled samples.	Training used roughly 12 million labeled samples.	Rounding preserves scale and meaning for many contexts.	0.3 million difference may matter for fairness, coverage, and compute estimates; ‘roughly’ could be read as approximate rather than counted.	technology_rnd	numerical_rounding_precision	high	high_ambiguity_numbers
40	The new chip tape-out occurred in October 2025.	The chip taped out in October 2025.	Same milestone and month.	‘New chip’ may specify which chip; external could be interpreted as the whole program rather than one variant.	technology_rnd	entity_specificity	high	high_ambiguity_mixed
41	The RMA rate stayed below 1% during the first 90 days after launch.	For the first 90 days post-launch, RMA remained under 1%.	Same threshold and window.	‘Stayed below’ implies continuous measurement; external could be interpreted as an average under 1%.	technology_rnd	threshold_boundary_scope;temporal_framing_precision;causality_vs_sequence	high	high_ambiguity_numbers
42	The product passed IEC 62368-1 safety testing on 5 Nov 2025.	IEC 62368-1 safety testing was passed on 5 Nov 2025.	Same standard and date.	Internal may refer to a specific lab’s test; external could be read as certification granted, which is a different step.	technology_rnd	temporal_framing_precision	medium	general
43	The app store rating increased from 4.2 to 4.3 after the December update.	After the December update, the app rating rose to 4.3 from 4.2.	Same change and anchor.	Internal might be weighted rating; external implies overall visible rating which can differ by region.	technology_rnd	temporal_framing_precision;causality_vs_sequence;scope_condition_omission	high	high_ambiguity_scope
44	The deprecation notice gives customers 18 months to migrate.	Customers are given an 18-month migration window in the deprecation notice.	Same migration period.	‘To migrate’ could mean complete migration; ‘window’ could be interpreted as time until partial migration or end-of-support.	technology_rnd	temporal_framing_precision	medium	general
45	The code review policy requires two reviewers for changes over 300 lines.	Changes larger than 300 lines need approval from two reviewers.	Same size threshold and reviewer count.	‘Requires’ vs ‘need approval’ could imply different enforcement; ‘over’ vs ‘larger than’ may treat exactly 300 lines differently.	technology_rnd	threshold_boundary_scope	high	high_ambiguity_numbers
46	The team estimates a 10–15% throughput gain from the new pipeline.	The new pipeline is expected to improve throughput by around 12%.	A midpoint estimate approximates the range.	A single-point expectation erases uncertainty and could be misleading if gains fall at 10% or 15%.	technology_rnd	modality_commitment_shift;numerical_rounding_precision;temporal_framing_precision	high	high_ambiguity_modality
47	The cloud migration moved 55% of services to region eu-central-1 by Dec 2025.	By Dec 2025, about 55% of services had migrated to eu-central-1.	Same fraction, region, and date.	‘Moved’ suggests completed cutover; ‘had migrated’ could include partially migrated services or traffic shadowing.	technology_rnd	numerical_rounding_precision;temporal_framing_precision;scope_condition_omission	high	high_ambiguity_scope
48	The feature is enabled for 20% of users via staged rollout.	A staged rollout has turned the feature on for about 20% of users.	Same rollout approach and exposure.	‘Enabled’ might mean can access; ‘turned on’ might imply actively used; also ‘about’ adds fuzziness.	technology_rnd	numerical_rounding_precision	high	high_ambiguity_numbers
49	In adults aged 65–80 with preexisting cardiovascular disease, daily walking reduced hospitalization rates by 9%.	Among adults 65–80 with cardiovascular disease, daily walking was linked to a 9% lower hospitalization rate.	Both keep the age band, condition, and 9% reduction framing.	‘Reduced’ suggests causal effect; ‘linked to’ is associational language. Also ‘preexisting’ is dropped which may matter.	health_science	temporal_framing_precision;correlation_vs_causation	high	high_ambiguity_scope
50	The trial met its primary endpoint at 12 weeks.	At week 12, the primary endpoint was achieved in the trial.	Same endpoint timing expressed differently.	‘Met’ can imply pre-specified statistical criteria; ‘achieved’ can be read as clinically meaningful without the same statistical bar.	health_science	near_paraphrase	medium	general
51	No serious adverse events were reported during Phase II.	Phase II reported no adverse events categorized as serious.	Both state absence of serious AEs in Phase II reporting.	‘Reported’ depends on reporting completeness; ‘categorized’ depends on classification—could differ by adjudication.	health_science	temporal_framing_precision	medium	general
52	Patient adherence remained above 90% throughout the study period.	Adherence stayed over 90% for the duration of the study.	Same threshold and full-study scope.	Internal could be medication adherence; external could be visit adherence; metric definition may differ.	health_science	threshold_boundary_scope;temporal_framing_precision;scope_condition_omission	high	high_ambiguity_scope
53	Median survival increased by 2.4 months relative to placebo.	Compared with placebo, median survival improved by 2.4 months.	Direct paraphrase with same effect size.	Could differ if internal is overall survival and external reads as progression-free survival; metric type not explicit.	health_science	temporal_framing_precision	medium	general
54	Results were replicated within a 95% confidence interval.	Replication fell within the 95% confidence bounds.	Same statistical statement with synonymous phrasing.	‘Within a 95% CI’ could mean overlap of intervals; ‘confidence bounds’ could refer to prediction intervals or different constructs.	health_science	near_paraphrase	medium	general
55	Measurement error accounted for less than 5% of the variance.	Less than 5% of variance was attributable to measurement error.	Same variance attribution statement.	Could differ if internal refers to explained variance in one model while external implies total variance in the phenomenon.	health_science	threshold_boundary_scope	high	high_ambiguity_numbers
56	The hypothesis was rejected at α = 0.05.	At the 5% significance level, the hypothesis was rejected.	Identical statistical threshold restated.	Could differ if a correction for multiple comparisons is assumed internally but not externally.	health_science	near_paraphrase	medium	general
57	Higher coffee consumption was associated with lower reported levels of depression.	Lower reported depression levels were observed among higher coffee consumers.	Both preserve association (not causation) and direction.	External could be read as implying a causal effect; also ‘reported levels’ vs ‘depression’ could mean different instruments.	health_science	correlation_vs_causation	high	high_ambiguity_scope
58	The correlation remained stable across three independent samples.	Across three independent samples, the correlation did not materially change.	Both indicate stability across samples.	‘Stable’ may allow minor variation; ‘did not materially change’ introduces a judgment threshold.	health_science	near_paraphrase	medium	general
59	The vaccine showed 74% efficacy against symptomatic disease in the 18–55 cohort.	In participants aged 18–55, efficacy against symptomatic disease was 74%.

60	Dose-limiting toxicity was not observed up to 200 mg/day.	No dose-limiting toxicity was seen at doses up to 200 mg/day.	Equivalent phrasing of same safety finding and dose ceiling.	‘Not observed’ could reflect limited sample size; ‘was seen’ could be interpreted as stronger evidence of absence.	health_science	strength_intensity_shift	high	high_ambiguity_strength
61	The study enrolled 240 patients across 6 hospitals between 2019 and 2020.	Between 2019 and 2020, 240 patients from 6 hospitals were enrolled.	Same counts, sites, and period.	‘Across 6 hospitals’ could include multi-site networks; ‘from 6 hospitals’ implies patients originated there—subtle sourcing difference.	health_science	near_paraphrase	medium	general
62	The endpoint was met in 8 of 14 study sites.	Eight of the fourteen study sites met the endpoint.	Same fraction restated.	Internal could mean site-level analysis; external might be read as patient-level success aggregated by site.	health_science	temporal_framing_precision	medium	general
63	The model’s error rate decreased by 0.7 percentage points after recalibration.	After recalibration, the error rate fell by 0.7 percentage points.	Same effect size and intervention.

70	The previous moderation strategy relied on independent fact-checkers certified through IFCN.	The prior moderation approach centered on IFCN-certified independent fact-checkers.	Same reliance and certification attribute preserved.	‘Relied on’ could include other tools; ‘centered on’ implies primary mechanism, potentially overstating exclusivity.	governance_policy	temporal_framing_precision	medium	general
71	To date, global sustainability regulations have had no material impact on results of operations.	So far, sustainability regulations have not materially affected results of operations.	Both say no material impact so far.	‘No material impact’ is an accounting term; ‘not materially affected’ might be interpreted more loosely.	governance_policy	near_paraphrase	medium	general
72	The company sources 60% of its electricity from renewables in 2025.	In 2025, renewables provided about 60% of the company’s electricity.

78	Institutional trust declined by 9 points between 2018 and 2023.	From 2018 to 2023, institutional trust fell by nine points.	Same magnitude and interval.	Internal may be an index with sampling error; external treats it as a precise fact across populations.	governance_policy	temporal_framing_precision	medium	general
79	The report notes the change may increase polarization risks.	The report warns the change could raise polarization risks.	‘Notes’ and ‘warns’ both convey concern about increased risk.	‘Warns’ is stronger and implies higher confidence or urgency than ‘notes’.	governance_policy	strength_intensity_shift	high	high_ambiguity_strength
80	The company committed to net-zero for Scope 1 and 2 by 2040.	The company targets net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040.	Commitment/target both indicate the same 2040 net-zero intention.	‘Committed’ can be binding and accountable; ‘targets’ may be aspirational without enforcement.	governance_policy	temporal_framing_precision;strength_intensity_shift;scope_condition_omission	high	high_ambiguity_scope

Exact boundary ambiguity (CHF 200 exactly) and potential pre-approved exemptions are not represented in external claim.	governance_policy	threshold_boundary_scope	high	high_ambiguity_numbers
83	The spokesperson said there was no evidence of customer data exfiltration.	The spokesperson said customer data exfiltration was not evidenced.	Same claim of no evidence, restated.	‘No evidence’ does not equal ‘did not happen’; external phrasing may be interpreted as stronger denial.	governance_policy	strength_intensity_shift	high	high_ambiguity_strength
84	Moral responsibility diminishes when autonomy is significantly constrained.	Significant constraints on autonomy reduce moral responsibility.	Both assert the same relationship between autonomy constraints and responsibility.	‘Diminishes’ suggests a gradient; ‘reduce’ can be read as categorical or unspecified degree.	philosophy_ethics	near_paraphrase	medium	general
85	Justice requires equal consideration of interests, not equal outcomes.	Justice demands interests be considered equally even when outcomes differ.	Both maintain equal consideration and reject outcome equality as requirement.	External could be read as endorsing outcome differences, while internal only says equal outcomes aren’t required.	philosophy_ethics	near_paraphrase	medium	general
86	Freedom involves the capacity to act otherwise, not merely absence of coercion.	Freedom is more than non-coercion; it includes the ability to choose differently.	Both define freedom as including alternative possibilities beyond coercion absence.	‘Capacity to act otherwise’ can be metaphysical; ‘choose differently’ can be interpreted psychologically or socially.	philosophy_ethics	near_paraphrase	medium	general
87	Ethical legitimacy depends partly on procedural fairness.	Procedural fairness contributes to ethical legitimacy.	Both say procedural fairness matters for legitimacy.	‘Depends partly’ implies it is necessary among factors; ‘contributes’ could be read as optional or minor.	philosophy_ethics	near_paraphrase	medium	general
88	Meaning arises from shared practices over extended periods of time.	Over time, shared practices generate meaning.	Both connect meaning with shared practice over time.	‘Extended periods’ stresses long duration; external could include short-term trends as ‘over time’.	philosophy_ethics	threshold_boundary_scope	high	high_ambiguity_numbers
89	Transparency can improve accountability but may reduce privacy in some contexts.	Greater transparency can raise accountability while sometimes limiting privacy.	Same trade-off relationship expressed.	‘May reduce’ vs ‘limiting’ implies different strength; ‘some contexts’ vs ‘sometimes’ changes scope.	philosophy_ethics	scope_condition_omission	high	high_ambiguity_scope
90	Consent is valid only when participants understand material risks.	Consent requires understanding of material risks to be valid.	Same necessary condition for valid consent.	‘Only when’ can imply strict requirement; ‘requires’ may allow partial understanding depending on interpretation.	philosophy_ethics	strength_intensity_shift	high	high_ambiguity_strength
91	Legitimacy is strengthened when decisions are publicly justifiable.	Publicly justifiable decisions tend to enhance legitimacy.	Both link public justification to legitimacy improvement.	‘Strengthened’ sounds causal; ‘tend to’ is probabilistic and weaker.	philosophy_ethics	near_paraphrase	medium	general
92	Fairness metrics can conflict, making single-score optimization difficult.	Because fairness metrics can conflict, optimizing a single score is often hard.	Both say metric conflict complicates optimization.	‘Can conflict’ is possibility; ‘because ...’ suggests conflict is a given in the scenario.	philosophy_ethics	causality_vs_sequence	high	high_ambiguity_causality
93	Collective responsibility increases as coordination among actors increases.	As actors coordinate more, collective responsibility tends to rise.	Both state a positive relationship between coordination and collective responsibility.	‘Increases as’ implies monotonic relationship; ‘tends to’ allows exceptions and could be seen as weaker.	philosophy_ethics	near_paraphrase	medium	general
94	A policy is ethically defensible if it balances harms and benefits transparently.	Transparent balancing of harms and benefits can make a policy ethically defensible.	Both say transparent trade-off balancing supports ethical defensibility.	‘If’ implies sufficiency; ‘can make’ implies not always sufficient.	philosophy_ethics	near_paraphrase	medium	general
95	Equality of opportunity does not guarantee equality of outcomes.	Equal opportunity can still result in unequal outcomes.	Same idea restated.	‘Does not guarantee’ is formal; ‘can still’ might be read as endorsing unequal outcomes as acceptable.	philosophy_ethics	causality_vs_sequence;strength_intensity_shift	high	high_ambiguity_causality
96	Bias mitigation may shift errors across groups rather than eliminate them.	Reducing bias can redistribute errors between groups.	Both describe trade-off/redistribution nature of mitigation.	‘May’ vs ‘can’ differs; ‘redistribute’ implies a definite shift whereas ‘may shift’ is conditional.	philosophy_ethics	near_paraphrase	medium	general
97	Trust depends on both competence and perceived intent.	Competence and perceived intent both shape trust.	Same two-factor view of trust.	‘Depends on’ could imply necessity; ‘shape’ could allow trust to be formed without one factor.	philosophy_ethics	near_paraphrase	medium	general
98	Accountability mechanisms work best when incentives align with stated values.	Aligned incentives help accountability mechanisms function well.	Both link incentive alignment to effective accountability.	‘Work best’ implies comparative optimum; ‘help’ is weaker and could imply they are not essential.	philosophy_ethics	near_paraphrase	medium	general
99	Alexandra Bastedo was a vegetarian and an animal welfare advocate.	Alexandra Bastedo followed a vegetarian lifestyle.	A vegetarian lifestyle is a concise restatement of being a vegetarian.	‘Lifestyle’ can imply a consistent long-term practice and may omit nuance (e.g., periods of vegetarianism, motive, or strictness).	philosophy_ethics	near_paraphrase	medium	general
100	WizzyPro is a Nigerian record producer signed to BeatBox.	BeatBox has signed at least one Nigerian record producer.	If WizzyPro is signed and is Nigerian, then BeatBox has signed a Nigerian producer.	External claim is weaker and could be interpreted as referring to current roster or a different time period than the internal statement.	philosophy_ethics	entity_specificity	high	high_ambiguity_mixed
